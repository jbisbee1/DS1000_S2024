# Agenda

1. ChatGPT overview

2. Interactive examples with the homework

# ChatGPT overview

- **L**arge **L**anguage **M**odel (LLM)

--

- Large:

--

  - Trained on the internet
  
  - Billions (trillions) of parameters
  
--

- Language model:

--

  - A "transformer"
  
---

# ChatGPT overview

- Fill in the missing word: **"I drove my ___ to the supermarket."**

--

- How do we know this?

--

- Patterns!

# ChatGPT overview

- Researchers have been trying to emulate the brain's ability for years

---

# ChatGPT overview

- Approach is fundamentally to **predict the next word**

---

# ChatGPT overview

- Artificial intelligence (AI) has improved enormously over the last 20 years

--

- But even in 2017, "chatbots" would fail the "Turing Test"

# ChatGPT overview

- Innovations in 2017 allowed dramatic improvements in **G**enerative **P**re-trained **T**ransformers (GPT)

--

  - (Actually, dramatic improvements in all types of transformers)
  
--

- Interacting with ChatGPT can feel truly human

--

  - Passes the Turing Test
  
--

- But under the hood, it is still simply predicting the next word

--

  - Importantly, it is doing so **probabilistically**

# So how can we use it?

- Interactive time!

# Conclusion

- Go to Brightspace and take the quiz
