# Agenda

1. Recap of last lecture

--

  - Using packages: `install.packages()` & `require()`
  
  - Loading and manipulating data: `readRDS()` and `%>%`
  
--

2. `tidyverse` functions

--

  - `filter` and `select`
  
  - `summarize` and `mutate`
  
  - `group_by`

---

# Loading Packages & Data

--

- Create an `.Rmd` file and save to your `code` folder

--

  - Accept defaults, Save As... (with a good name), then `knit`

--

- Load the `tidyverse` package

```{r,message=F,warning=F}
require(tidyverse)
```

--

- Load the data from the course [github page](https://github.com/jbisbee1/DS1000_S2024/raw/main/data/sc_debt.Rds) directly using `read_rds()`

--

  - We **create** an "object" to store the data using a left-arrow: `<-`

--

```{r}
df<-read_rds("https://github.com/jbisbee1/DS1000_S2024/raw/main/data/sc_debt.Rds") 
```

---

# Tabular Data

- Data comes in many different formats

--

- **Structured data**: standardized, well-defined structure, easily accessed

  - I.e., tables, databases
  
  - In my YouTube example, the survey we gave was **structured**
  
--
  
- **Unstructured data**: messy, organic, disorganized, hard to use

  - I.e., web pages, images, videos
  
  - In my YouTube example, the scraped HTML code of a list of recommendations was **unstructured**
  
--

- In this class, we will always be working with **structured** data...specifically "tabular data frames"

--

- This still requires work to prepare!

---

# Tabular Data Frame

- AKA a "tibble"

--

- These are "square" (although actually rectagular)

--

- Rows: **units of observation** (i.e., the entities we are studying)

--

  - People (each row is a survey respondent, athlete, etc.)
  
  - Places (each row is a state, county, country, etc.)
  
  - Things (each row is a tweet, firm, product, etc.)
  
--

- Columns: **variables of interest** (i.e., attributes we are studying)

--

  - Beliefs / behaviors / etc. (i.e., where rows are people)
  
  - Rainfall / crimes / etc. (i.e., where rows are places)
  
  - Likes / profits / etc. (i.e., where rows are things)
  
---

# Looking at Data

--

- We now have the contents of `sc_debt.Rds` stored in the object `df`

--

- We can look at this object directly

```{r}
df
```

---

# Looking at Data

- What is our **unit of observation**?

--

  - Academic institutions: each row is a single school

--

- What are our **variables of interest**?

--

  - Let's look!
  
```{r}
colnames(df) # Prints the variable names
```

---

# Good Data has Codebooks!

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
defs <- data.frame(Name = names(df),
                   Definition = c('Unit ID','Institution Name','State Abbreviation','Median Debt of Graduates',
                            'Control Public or Private','Census Region','Predominant Degree Offered: Assocates or Bachelors',
                            'Open Admissions Policy: 1=Yes, 2=No, 3=No 1st time students',
                            'Admissions Rate: proportion of applications accepted','Type of institution*',
                            'Average SAT scores',
                            'Average Earnings of Recent Graduates',
                            'Number of undergraduates',
                            'Average cost of attendance (tuition-grants)',
                            'Institution admits fewer than 10% of applications, 1=Yes, 0=No',
                            'Institution is a research university, 1=Yes, 0=No'))
```

```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
require(kableExtra)
defs %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F,font_size = 13)

# Manipulating the Data

--

- These data are cool!

--

- But TMI at first

--

- I want to know...

--

  1. Where is `Vanderbilt University`?
  
--

  2. Which school is the most selective?
  
--

  3. Which schools produce the richest grads?
  
---

# Manipulating with `tidyverse`

- The code process of `tidyverse` relies on a "pipe" symbol: `%>%`

--

  - I don't like this name
  
  - I think it should be called a "chain" because it **links code together**
  
  - Or maybe a "do" symbol because it tells `R` what to do
  
  - Others refer to it as a "then" symbol, which is a little better
  
--

- The basic grammar of `R` is: object, `%>%`, verb

```{r,eval=FALSE}
object %>%  # This is the object
   function() # This is the verb
```

---

# Manipulating with `tidyverse`

- `tidyverse` has many useful "verbs" (i.e., functions)

  - `filter()`: subsets **rows**
  
  - `select()`: subsets **columns**
  
  - `arrange()`: sorts **rows** based on **columns**
  
  - `summarise()`: collapses **rows**
  
  - `group_by()`: groups **rows** by **columns**
  
---

# Manipulating: `filter()`

- So let's look at Vandy

--

- `filter` will select **rows** of the data based on some criteria

--

```{r}
df %>%
  filter(instnm == "Vanderbilt University") # Only select rows with Vandy
```

---

# Manipulating: `select()`

- Still TMI!

--

- I only care about the admissions rate (`adm_rate`), the SAT scores (`sat_avg`), and the future earnings (`md_earn_wne_p6`)

--

- `select` will select **columns**

```{r}
df %>%
  filter(instnm == "Vanderbilt University") %>%
  select(instnm,adm_rate,sat_avg,md_earn_wne_p6) # Select variables of interest
```

---

# Manipulating: `arrange()`

- How does Vandy compare...?

--

  - to other schools in terms of SAT scores?
  
  - to other schools in terms of future earnings?
  
  - to other schools in terms of admissions rates?

--

- `arrange` will sort the data based on a column (ascending!)

```{r}
df %>%
  arrange(sat_avg) %>% # Sort data by SAT scores
  select(instnm,sat_avg) # Only look at name and SAT scores
```

---

# Manipulating: `arrange()`

- Vandy is not in the bottom 10 schools

```{r}
df %>%
  arrange(sat_avg) %>% # Sort data by SAT scores
  select(instnm,sat_avg) # Only look at name and SAT scores
```

---

# Manipulating: `arrange()`

- Use `desc()` to order in descending values...Vandy not in top 10 either

```{r}
df %>%
  arrange(desc(sat_avg)) %>% # Sort data by SAT scores (descending)
  select(instnm,sat_avg) # Only look at name and SAT scores
```

---

# Manipulating: `arrange()`

- What if we look only at "selective" schools?

--

```{r}
df %>%
  filter(adm_rate < .1) %>% # Only schools who accept < 10%
  arrange(sat_avg,adm_rate) %>% # Sort by SAT scores (ascending)
  select(instnm,sat_avg) # Only look at name and SAT scores
```


---

# How does Vandy compare?

- `arrange` in descending order

```{r}
df %>%
  filter(adm_rate < .1) %>% # Only schools who accept < 10%
  arrange(desc(sat_avg),adm_rate) %>% # Descending SAT scores
  select(instnm,sat_avg) # Only look at name and SAT scores
```



---

# More complicated? More `%>%`!

--

- Less selective schools by SAT with debt and state

```{r}
df %>%
  # Less selective schools (accept 20% to 30%)
  filter(adm_rate > .2 & adm_rate < .3) %>%
  # Sort by state name, then by SAT scores (descending)
  arrange(stabbr,desc(sat_avg)) %>% 
  # Only look at variables of interest
  select(instnm,sat_avg,grad_debt_mdn,stabbr) 
```

---

# A quick aside on missingness

--

- Some rows have `NA` in some columns, indicating **missing data**
  
  - Data can be missing for many different reasons

--

- `NA` values will produce `NA` summaries for common functions

```{r}
mean(c(1,2,3))
mean(c(1,2,3,NA))
```
--

- Helpers: `is.na()` and `na.rm=T`

```{r}
mean(c(1,2,3,NA),na.rm=T)
```
  
---

# A quick aside on missingness

- Use `is.na()` and `filter()` to see how many schools don't report SATs

```{r}
df %>%
  filter(is.na(sat_avg)) %>% # Only schools that DON'T report SATs
  select(instnm,stabbr) # Only view name and state
```


---

# Stepping back

--

- Thus far, lots of .red[data]

--

- Not a lot of .blue[science]

--

- But remember the .blue[Research] camp!

--

  1. .red[Observation] &rarr; .blue[Question]

  2. .blue[Theory] &rarr; .blue[Hypothesis]

  3. .red[Data Collection / Wrangling] &rarr; .red[Analysis]

  4. .red[Results] &rarr; .blue[Conclusion]
  
--

- We have been doing lots of .red[Observation]!

--

- Do we have any good .blue[Research questions]?

---

# Stepping back

- .blue[RQ]: How might admissions and SAT scores be **related**?

--

  - .blue[Theory]: selective schools have stricter criteria
  
--

  - .blue[Hypothesis]: admissions and SAT scores should be **negatively** related
  
--

- How can we test this hypothesis?


---

# Summarizing Data: `summarise()` + `mean()`

--

- We can combine base `R` functions with `tidyverse` functions!

--

  - Base `R`: `mean()`
  
  - `tidyverse`: `summarise()` (aka `summarize()`)
  
- Overall average SAT scores

```{r}
df %>%
  summarise(mean_sat = mean(sat_avg,na.rm=T)) # Average SAT scores for entire data
```

---

# Summarizing Data

- Let's unpack this

```{r,eval=F}
df %>%
  summarise(mean_sat = mean(sat_avg,na.rm=T))
```

--

  - Create new variable `mean_sat` that contains the `mean()` of every school's average SAT score
  
--

  - `na.rm=T` means we want to ignore missing data. If not?
  
--
  
```{r,eval=T}
df %>%
  summarise(mean_sat = mean(sat_avg))
```

---

# Summarizing Data

--

- Recall we want see if more selective schools have higher SAT scores

--

```{r,eval=T}
df %>%
  filter(adm_rate < .1) %>% # Only schools who accept < 10%
  summarise(mean_sat_LT10 = mean(sat_avg,na.rm=T)) # Average SAT
```

```{r,eval=T}
df %>%
  filter(adm_rate > .1) %>% # Only schools who accept > 10%
  summarise(mean_sat_GT20 = mean(sat_avg,na.rm=T)) # Average SAT
```

---

# Adding / changing variables: `mutate()`

--

- `mutate()` creates a new variable

--

```{r}
df %>%
  mutate(newvar = 1) %>%
  select(instnm,newvar)
```

---

# Object Assignment Operator: `<-`

- Thus far, nothing we have done has changed `df`

--

- Use object assignment operator `<-` to **overwrite** an existing object

--

```{r}
df <- df %>%
  mutate(adm_rate_pct = adm_rate*100)
```

--

- Did it work?

```{r}
df %>%
  summarise(adm_rate_pct = mean(adm_rate_pct,na.rm=T),
            adm_rate = mean(adm_rate,na.rm=T))
```

---

# Logic: `ifelse()`

- 3 inputs:

  - Logical statement (labeled `test`)
  
  - Value if the logic is `TRUE` (labeled `yes`)
  
  - Value if the logic is `FALSE` (labeled `no`)
  
--

- `ifelse([LOGIC],[VALUE IF TRUE],[VALUE IF FALSE])`

---

# Logic: `ifelse()`

- Say it out loud: "Create a new variable called `sel` that records if the school is selective or not. If the admissions rate is less than 10% (0.1), record the school as `sel = 1`. Otherwise, record the school as `sel = 0`."

```{r,eval = F}
df %>%
  mutate(sel = ifelse(test = [LOGIC],
                      yes = [VALUE IF TRUE],
                      no = [VALUE IF FALSE]))
```
---

# Logic: `ifelse()`

- Say it out loud: "Create a new variable called `sel` that records if the school is selective or not. **If the admissions rate is less than 10% (0.1)**, record the school as `sel = 1`. Otherwise, record the school as `sel = 0`."

```{r,eval = F}
df %>%
  mutate(sel = ifelse(test = `adm_rate < 0.1`, # This is the logic
                      yes = [VALUE IF TRUE],
                      no = [VALUE IF FALSE]))
```

---

# Logic: `ifelse()`

- Say it out loud: "Create a new variable called `sel` that records if the school is selective or not. If the admissions rate is less than 10% (0.1), **record the school as `sel = 1`**. Otherwise, record the school as `sel = 0`."

```{r,eval = F}
df %>%
  mutate(sel = ifelse(test = adm_rate < 0.1, # This is the logic
                      yes = `1`, # This is the value if TRUE
                      no = [VALUE IF FALSE]))
```
---

# Logic: `ifelse()`

- Say it out loud: "Create a new variable called `sel` that records if the school is selective or not. If the admissions rate is less than 10% (0.1), record the school as `sel = 1`. **Otherwise, record the school as `sel = 0`**."

```{r,eval = F}
df %>%
  mutate(sel = ifelse(test = adm_rate < 0.1, # This is the logic
                      yes = 1, # This is the value if TRUE
                      no = `0`)) # This is the value if FALSE
```
---

# Logic: `ifelse()` + `mutate()`

- Remember that if we want to keep this, we need the **assignment operator** `<-`

```{r}
df <- df %>%
  mutate(sel = ifelse(test = adm_rate < 0.1, # This is the logic
                      yes = 1, # This is the value if TRUE
                      no = 0)) # This is the value if FALSE
```


---

# Summarizing Data: `group_by()`

--

- One final `tidyverse` function: `group_by()`

--

- Let's use the newly created `selective` variable which is either 1 or 0

--

```{r}
df %>%
  select(instnm,selective,adm_rate)
```

---

# Summarizing Data: `group_by()`

- Instead of running two separate `filter()` commands, use `group_by()`

--

```{r,eval=T}
df %>%
  # Group the data by selective (either 1 or 0)
  group_by(selective) %>% 
  # Calculate average SAT for each group
  summarise(mean_sat = mean(sat_avg,na.rm=T)) 
```

---

# Results

- Do more selective schools have higher SAT scores?

--

- Yes

--

- This .red[Result] **confirms** our .blue[Hypothesis] and **answers** our .blue[Research Question]

---

# Conclusion

--

- What we've done today is a microcosm of data science

--

  1. Opened .red[data] (`readRDS`)
  
--
  
  2. Looked at .red[data] (`tidyverse` + `select()`, `filter()`, `arrange()`)
    
--

  3. Generated .blue[hypotheses] (Admissions versus SAT scores)
  
--

  4. .red[Tested] .blue[hypotheses] (`summarise()` + `mean()`)

# Advanced Logic: `filter()`

[If no time, jump to end](#end)

- `filter()` command with other logical operators

--
  - `>, <`: greater than, less than (`>=, <=`)
  - `!`: not (i.e., `!=` means "not equal to")
  - `&`: and
  - `|`: or
  
--

```{r}
df %>%
  # Schools EXCEPT Vandy
  filter(instnm != "Vanderbilt University") %>%
  select(instnm,stabbr,adm_rate,sat_avg)
```

---

# Advanced Logic: `str_detect()`

- `filter()` command with other functions

--

  - `str_detect([VAR],[PATTERN])`: detect a string
  - `grepl([PATTERN],[VAR])`: also detects a string

--

```{r}
df %>%
  filter(str_detect(instnm,"Vanderbilt")) %>%
  select(instnm,stabbr,adm_rate,sat_avg)
```

---

# Advanced Logic: `str_detect()`

- String detection is case sensitive!

--

```{r}
df %>%
  filter(str_detect(instnm,"VAND")) %>%
  select(instnm,stabbr,adm_rate,sat_avg)
```

--

```{r}
df %>%
  filter(str_detect(instnm,"anderbil")) %>%
  select(instnm,stabbr,adm_rate,sat_avg)
```

---

# Advanced Logic: `&` (and), `|` (or)

```{r}
df %>%
  filter(str_detect(instnm,"Colorado")) %>%
  select(instnm,stabbr,adm_rate,sat_avg)
```

---

# Advanced Logic: `&` (and), `|` (or)

```{r}
df %>%
  filter(grepl("Colorado",instnm) & grepl(' of ',instnm)) %>%
  select(instnm,stabbr,adm_rate,sat_avg)
```

---

# Advanced Logic: `&` (and), `|` (or)

```{r}
df %>%
  filter(grepl("Colorado",instnm) | grepl('Vermont',instnm)) %>%
  select(instnm,stabbr,adm_rate,sat_avg)
```

---

# Advanced Logic: `&` (and), `|` (or)

```{r}
df %>%
  filter((grepl("Colorado",instnm) | grepl('Vermont',instnm)) & grepl(' of ',instnm)) %>%
  select(instnm,stabbr,adm_rate,sat_avg)
```

---

# Advanced Logic: `&` (and), `|` (or)

- `&` can be separated into multiple `filter()` commands

```{r}
df %>%
  filter((grepl("Colorado",instnm) | grepl('Vermont',instnm))) %>%
  filter(grepl(' of ',instnm)) %>%
  select(instnm,stabbr,adm_rate,sat_avg)
```

---

# Advanced Logic: `&` (and), `|` (or)

- `|` can be moved into the `str_detect()` or `grepl()` commands

```{r}
df %>%
  filter(grepl("Colorado|Vermont",instnm)) %>%
  filter(grepl(' of ',instnm)) %>%
  select(instnm,stabbr,adm_rate,sat_avg)
```

---

# Quick Test

- Filter schools from Texas with the word "community" in their name

```{r}
# INSERT CODE HERE
```

---

# Advanced Logic: `select()`

- `select` can be paired with `matches()` or `contains()` for similar flexibility (equivalent to `str_detect()` or `grepl()` for `filter()`)

--

```{r}
df %>%
  select(contains('inst'))
```

---

# Advanced Logic: `select()`

- `matches` can work with `|`

```{r}
df %>%
  select(!matches('_|inst'))
```

---

# Advanced Logic: `select()`

- `select` can also work with `where` to find classes

```{r}
df %>%
  select(where(is.numeric))
```

---

# Quick Test

- Filter to only schools in California and select only character columns

```{r}
# INSERT CODE HERE
```
